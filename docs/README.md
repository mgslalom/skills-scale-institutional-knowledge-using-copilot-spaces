# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README serves as the entry point for OctoAcme's program and project management processes. It summarizes OctoAcme's approach and links to the detailed process documents.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows an iterative, customer-first project management approach that balances structure with adaptability. Projects progress through clear stages—Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective—so teams can align on objectives, plan work effectively, deliver value continuously, and learn from each iteration. Workflows emphasize short feedback cycles, regular demos, and stakeholder alignment to keep teams focused on delivering business impact.

## Roles & Communication

Key personas include Project Managers (own schedule, risks, stakeholder coordination), Product Managers (define priorities and success criteria), Developers (implement features), QA Engineers (verify quality and guardrails), and Stakeholders (provide input and accept outcomes). Communication strategies combine asynchronous documentation (requirements, meeting notes, decision logs) with regular synchronous touchpoints (planning meetings, sprint reviews, and retrospectives) and status updates via the team's chosen channels (e.g., issue trackers, Slack, and shared docs).

## Quality Assurance & Workflows

Quality assurance is integrated into development through automated testing, CI pipelines, code reviews, and acceptance criteria for each work item. QA is involved early—during planning and through continuous testing during execution—to reduce defects and ensure readiness for release. Releases follow a documented deployment guide and include verification steps and stakeholder communication. After each release, teams run retrospectives to capture improvements and update process artifacts.
