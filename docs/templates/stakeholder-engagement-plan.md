## Project Information

**Project Name:** [Project Name]  
**Project Manager:** [Name]

## Stakeholder Mapping

Identify and categorize all stakeholders based on their influence and interest in the project.

### Stakeholder Identification Matrix

| Stakeholder Name/Group | Role/Department | Influence Level | Interest Level | Category |
|------------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| [Name/Group] | [Role] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [See categories below] |
| [Name/Group] | [Role] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Category] |
| [Name/Group] | [Role] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | [Category] |

### Stakeholder Categories

Based on influence and interest levels:

- **Manage Closely** (High Influence, High Interest): Key decision-makers and active supporters. Require regular engagement and input.
- **Keep Satisfied** (High Influence, Low Interest): Influential but not deeply engaged. Keep informed to maintain support.
- **Keep Informed** (Low Influence, High Interest): Interested but limited influence. Provide regular updates and opportunities for feedback.
- **Monitor** (Low Influence, Low Interest): Minimal engagement needed. Provide periodic updates.

| End Users | Newsletter | Monthly | Email | Stakeholder Liaison | Feature updates, training |
| External Partners | Coordination Call | Weekly | Video | Stakeholder Liaison | Integration, dependencies |
| QA Team | Test Review | As needed | Slack + Meeting | QA Lead | Quality gates, defects |

**Customization Note:** Adjust frequency and channels based on stakeholder needs and project phase.

## Communication Channels

### Available Channels

Define which channels are used for different types of communication.

| Channel | Purpose | Stakeholder Groups | Frequency |
|---------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Email** | Formal updates, documentation | All stakeholders | Varies by group |
| **Slack/Teams** | Quick updates, collaboration | Internal team, partners | Daily/Real-time |
| **Project Portal/Wiki** | Documentation, artifacts | All stakeholders | Continuous (on-demand) |
| **Video Meetings** | Reviews, alignment, decisions | Sponsors, steering committee | Weekly/Monthly |
| **Newsletter** | Broad updates, announcements | End users, broader org | Monthly |
| **Dashboard/Metrics** | Real-time project status | PM, sponsors, team | Continuous (on-demand) |

### Channel Selection Criteria

- **Urgency:** High-urgency items use Slack/Teams or direct calls; low-urgency uses email or portals
- **Formality:** Formal approvals and documentation via email and portal; informal updates via Slack
- **Audience Size:** Large audiences use newsletters and portals; small groups use meetings and direct messages

---

## Feedback Loop

Ensure stakeholder input is captured, addressed, and communicated back.

### Feedback Collection Methods

- [ ] Regular feedback sessions (schedule: [frequency])
- [ ] Surveys and questionnaires (tools: [SurveyMonkey, Google Forms, etc.])
- [ ] Open office hours (schedule: [day/time])
- [ ] Retrospectives with stakeholder representatives
- [ ] Issue/feedback tracking system (tool: [GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.])

### Feedback Processing Workflow

1. **Collect Feedback**
   - Stakeholder Liaison gathers input via scheduled touchpoints and ad-hoc requests

2. **Log and Categorize**
   - Document feedback in tracking system
   - Tag by theme: feature request, issue, question, concern

3. **Prioritize and Triage**
   - Project Manager and Product Manager review and prioritize
   - Categorize as: implement, defer, decline, or needs clarification

4. **Take Action**
   - Assign action items to appropriate team members
   - Update project plan or backlog as needed

5. **Close the Loop**
   - Stakeholder Liaison communicates back to stakeholders
   - Explain decisions, timelines, and next steps
   - Document in meeting notes or status updates

### Feedback Response SLA

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 2 business days
- **Initial Response:** Within 1 week
- **Resolution or Update:** Based on priority (High: 2 weeks, Medium: 1 month, Low: Next planning cycle)

---

## Escalation Path

Define how to escalate issues when normal channels are insufficient.

### Escalation Levels

| Level | Role | When to Escalate | Response Time |
|-------|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Level 1** | Stakeholder Liaison | Routine concerns, clarifications | 2 business days |
| **Level 2** | Project Manager | Scope, schedule, resource conflicts | 3 business days |
| **Level 3** | Project Sponsor | Strategic decisions, budget, organizational blockers | 1 week |
| **Level 4** | Executive Leadership | Critical business risks, legal/compliance, major failures | Immediate |

### Escalation Criteria

Escalate when:
- Stakeholder concerns are not resolved at current level within SLA
- Issue impacts project scope, schedule, or budget significantly
- Cross-functional or organizational barriers require executive intervention
- Risks to project success or stakeholder relationships are identified

### Escalation Process

1. **Identify Issue:** Stakeholder Liaison or team member identifies need for escalation
2. **Document:** Log issue details, stakeholders involved, and resolution attempts
3. **Notify Next Level:** Escalate to appropriate role with summary and recommended action
4. **Track:** Monitor escalation progress and communicate status to stakeholders
5. **Resolve and Close Loop:** Communicate resolution back to original stakeholder
